# UIED - UI element detection, detecting UI elements from UI screenshots or drawnings

This project is still ongoing and this repo may be updated irregularly, I developed a web app for the UIED in http://uied.online

>The repo has been **upgraded with Google OCR** for GUI text detection, to use the original version in our paper (using [EAST](https://github.com/argman/EAST) as text detector), check the relase [v2.3](https://github.com/MulongXie/UIED/releases/tag/v2.3) and download the pre-trained model in [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MK0Om7Lx0wRXGDfNcyj21B0FL1T461v5?usp=sharing).

## What is it?

UI Element Detection (UIED) is an old-fashioned computer vision (CV) based element detection approach for graphic user interface. 

The input of UIED could be various UI image, such as mobile app or web page screenshot, UI design drawn by Photoshop or Sketch, and even some hand-drawn UI design. Then the approach detects and classifies text and graphic UI elements, and exports the detection result as JSON file for future application. 

UIED comprises two parts to detect UI text and graphic elements, such as button, image and input bar. 
* For text, it leverages [Google OCR](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/ocr) to perfrom detection. 

* For graphical elements, it uses old-fashioned CV approaches to locate the elements and a CNN classifier to achieve classification. 

> UIED is highly customizable, you can replace both parts by your choice (e.g. other text detection approaches). Unlike black-box end-to-end deep learning approach, you can revise the algorithms in the non-text detection and merging (partially or entirely) easily to fit your task.

## How to use?

### Dependency
* **Python 3.5**
* **Opencv 3.4.2**
* **Pandas**
* **Google Cloud Vision** ([link](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/libraries))
<!-- * **Tensorflow 1.10.0**
* **Keras 2.2.4**
* **Sklearn 0.22.2** -->

### Installation
<!-- Install the mentioned dependencies, and download two pre-trained models from [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MK0Om7Lx0wRXGDfNcyj21B0FL1T461v5?usp=sharing) for EAST text detection and GUI element classification. -->

<!-- Change ``CNN_PATH`` and ``EAST_PATH`` in *config/CONFIG.py* to your locations. -->

The new version of UIED equipped with Google OCR is easy to deploy and no pre-trained model is needed. Simply donwload the repo along with the dependencies.

> Please either export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS in your environment or provide the path to the private key file for Google Cloud Vision at `detect_text/ocr.py line 13` (apply in [Google website](https://cloud.google.com/vision), then follow the [Setup](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/setup#auth-env)).

### Usage
To test your own image(s):
* To test single image, change *input_path_img* in ``run_single.py`` to your input image and the results will be output to *output_root*.
* To test mutiple images, change *input_img_root* in ``run_batch.py`` to your input directory and the results will be output to *output_root*.
* To adjust the parameters lively, using ``run_testing.py`` 

> Note: The best set of parameters vary for different types of GUI image (Mobile App, Web, PC). I highly recommend to first play with the ``run_testing.py`` to pick a good set of parameters for your data.
